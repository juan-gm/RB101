inputs:
  the loan amount
  Annual Percentage Rate
  loan duration... months and years, then converted to months


outputs:
  monthly interest rate 
  loan duration in months
  monthly payment

Sabemos que el monthly payment viene de la siguiente fÃ³rmula:
m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

m = monthly payment??
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate?? --> APR / 12
n = loan duration in months

APR must be converted into a monthly interest rate


Test cases
(10000, 5, 8 months) ---> (??,8, 1273.03)

Edge cases:
  - Loan amount > 0
  - APR > 0.. >1??
  - Loan duration. Years must be an int >= 0, and
  monts the same. But if years are 0, monts can't
  be zero too! Maybe they should be less than 12, but
  that is not 100% neccesary.

Data structure
Basically, now I just have to calculate every element of
the formula and then just apply the formula to get
the monthly payments.
We have to be careful with the float/integer numbers, as
it is probable that the user info will be int.

So now algorithm! The most interesting part.
First, ask for the data input:
  - The total loan amount
  - APR, as a percentage
  - Loan duration. First ask how many years and then
  how many months. After it must be converted to 
  months only.

Second, calculate the missing parts of the equation,
which are also required output for our program:
  - The monthly interest rate, which is just APR / 12
  - The loan duration in months, which we calculate
  very easily from the loan duration.

Finally, we just have to calculate the monthly payment
applying the formula, and print/output the required
results.
